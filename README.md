FIDIMAG: a finite difference micromagnetic simulation environment

Fidimag solves finite-difference micromagnetic problems and also
supports atomistic simulations, both using a Python interface.

The webpage of the project is http://computationalmodelling.github.io/fidimag/

The documentation is at http://fidimag.readthedocs.io/en/latest/?badge=latest

Various options of installation are described in the documentation, mostly by compiling from source. If you install from source, you'll want to add the path this file is in to your $PYTHONPATH. Check the [documentation](http://fidimag.readthedocs.org) for more
detailed installation help (but needs tidying up). The virtual micromagnetics project at http://virtualmicromagnetics.org provides virtual machines and docker containers in which fidimag can be executed. 

The code is developed by Weiwei Wang, Marc-Antonio Bisotti, David Cortes, Thomas Kluyver, Mark Vousden, Ryan Pepper, Oliver Laslett, Rebecca Carey, and Hans Fangohr at the University of Southampton.

This is a very early experimental version; contributions to tidy up code and documenation are welcome.

# Weiwei: TODO: Add an ignore for compiled .c files. This could be done by
# finding all .pyx files, and ignoring their corresponding .c files. Someone
# better at regular expressions than me could have a go at this.
# Marc-Antonio: So /(\w+)(?=\.pyx)/ would give you the `foo` in `foo.pyx`
# without including the `.pyx` in the match (keyword: positive lookahead)
# but I don't think you can then make it match to `foo.c` since the rules are
# applied for one file at a time (so there is no knowledge about other files
# when the regexp is evaluated against a file).
